# NOTE: this procedure relies on the use of rnammer-1.2 which is in my home
# directory. step4-make-rnammer-qsub-scripts.pl uses a hard-coded path
# to that executable: '/home/nawrocke/src/rnammer-1.2/rnammer'
# 

# NOTE: I had to manually modify rnammer slightly to get it to work at
# NCBI. Notes on that are in:
# /home/nawrocke/notebook/15_0622_inf_gpipe_ssu_lsu_rfam/00LOG.txt

#
# Commands are on lines that do not have a '#' as the first character.
#
# Step 1: get the CM files necessary for infernal tests:
sh step1-get-cmfiles.sh 

# Step 2: get the genomes
# This script randomly selects archaeal and bacterial genomes from 
# /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gpipe/bacterial_pipeline/data19/
# 
# This script has to determine which genomes are archaea and which are
# bacteria. It does so by matching certain strings that are known to 
# be archaeal specific. The script is deterministic in its choice of 
# genomes and I manually checked that the resulting genomes are the 
# correct domain.
#
perl step2-get-genomes.pl 

# Step 3: Make a script that will submit the infernal searches, and
# submit the jobs to the cluster:
perl step3-make-infernal-qsub-scripts.pl arc.r25.genome.list arc-infernal-out > arc.infernal.sh
perl step3-make-infernal-qsub-scripts.pl bac.r50.genome.list bac-infernal-out > bac.infernal.sh
sh arc.infernal.sh
sh bac.infernal.sh

# Step 4: Make a script that will submit the RNAmmer searches, and
# submit the jobs to the cluster:
perl step4-make-rnammer-qsub-scripts.pl arc.r25.genome.list arc-rnammer-out > arc.rnammer.sh
perl step4-make-rnammer-qsub-scripts.pl bac.r50.genome.list bac-rnammer-out > bac.rnammer.sh
sh arc.rnammer.sh 
sh bac.rnammer.sh 

# Step 5: Convert the infernal tblout output to GFF format:
ls arc-infernal-out/*.tbl | perl step5-wrapper-convert-infernal-to-gff.pl 
ls bac-infernal-out/*.tbl | perl step5-wrapper-convert-infernal-to-gff.pl 

# Step 6: Obtain NCBI rRNA GFF annotations:
perl step6-get-ncbi-annotations.pl arc.r25.genome.list arc-ncbi-annot
perl step6-get-ncbi-annotations.pl bac.r50.genome.list bac-ncbi-annot

# Step 7: Concatenate GFF annotations so we can easily compare all
# genomes at once:
sh step7-concatenate-gff.sh 

# Step 8: Perform all of the comparisons:
sh step8-wrapper-compare-gff.sh
# comparison output files are in comparison-output-files/ dir

# Step 9: Create final summary:
sh step9-wrapper-summarize-all-comparisons.sh > comparison-summary.txt
cat comparison-summary.txt
# The final summary is in comparison-summary.txt
